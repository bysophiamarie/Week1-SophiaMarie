    <p> Often politically charged issues fall into a journalistic trap of traditional cliches. Climate change is perfect example of a story frequently told through the same lens. We've all seen the lone polar bear stranded on a single melting ice block in the middle of the ocean. Since readers are already familiar with the image, they won't investigate further. History shows us that a desensitized public creates dangerous minds - cue the Trump Administration.</p>
    <p>This new digital age offers journalists new mediums to tell stories that not only keep audiences engaged, but also allows them to explore and create their own narratives--which in my opinion, is the future of journalism. </p>
    <p>As a Film Development Fellow at <a href="https://www.ryot.org/">RYOT</a> LA this summer, I saw the RYOT's creative vision. I helped research potential projects, drafted Immersive Deck proposals, and learned VR/AR/360 Video editing skills. I demonstrated my sound news judgment, excellent writing skills and thrived in its creative and collaborative office. </p>
    <p>In the Media Innovation program at Northeastern University, I'm just as productive. In my first year, I constructed a data visualization website tracking the status of financial corruption in each state, made a short video about fake news on Facebook, created an audio piece about the declining Atlantic Cod population, and profiled the New York Times' new climate change series, Changing Climate, Changing Cities, in a long form article. </p>
    <p>By leveraging technology in innovative ways, journalists can still shape perspectives, influence popular opinion, and inform the public. I want to be a part of that fast paced environment, where I can be an integral part of implementing successful ideas from start to finish.
